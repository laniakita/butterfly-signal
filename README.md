# Butterfly Signal

This is a browser extension that illuminates a butterfly when you visit a webpage that has it's domain registered on Bluesky. 

## Motivation

![A post by @bradgessler.com stating: "Ok who is building the browser extension for Safari that lights up a ðŸ¦‹ icon if the website Iâ€™m visiting has an _aproto DNS text record? When it lights up, I can click the icon and follow the account."](./assets/figure-01-motivation.png)

I liked [@bradgessler's](https://bsky.app/profile/bradgessler.com) idea so much, I wanted to bring it to life.

## Usage

Until this is made available on the chrome webstore (or whereever you get browser extensions), you'll have to download the latest release, and load it into your browser.
